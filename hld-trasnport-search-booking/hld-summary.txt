High-Level Design (HLD): Transport/Hotel Booking System
1. System Overview
This system allows users to:

Search transport (flight/train/bus) or hotel options.

Filter results.

Book tickets/rooms.

Handle payments.

Get confirmation via notifications.

2. Architecture Components
‚úÖ Clients
Web & Mobile Clients

Use HTTPS for communication

üåê API Gateway
Routes requests to appropriate services (Search, Booking, Payment, Auth)

Handles rate limiting, logging, and auth validation

üîê Authentication Service
JWT-based authentication (token generation on login/register)

Stateless session handling

Auth token sent in headers for every API request

‚öôÔ∏è Load Balancer
Round Robin or Least Connections strategy

Handles horizontal scaling of stateless microservices

üß© Microservices
Search Service: Handles search/filter logic using third-party APIs (uses Adapter pattern).

Booking Service: Manages bookings and interacts with payment (uses Facade + Strategy + Adapter).

Payment Service: Integrates with external payment gateways.

User Service: User profile and preferences.

Notification Service: Push/email notifications (asynchronous via Kafka).

3. Database Design
Table	Key Columns
User	user_id (PK), name, email, phone
Booking	booking_id (PK), user_id (FK), transport_id, payment_id, status
Transport	transport_id (PK), type (Flight/Train/Bus), provider_id
Payment	payment_id (PK), user_id (FK), mode, gateway, status
Provider	provider_id (PK), name (Indigo, RedBus, etc.)
Discount	discount_id (PK), code, amount, validity
4. Design Patterns Used
Pattern	Usage
Strategy	Choosing transport mode or payment mode
Adapter	Integrating various providers (SpiceJet, Indigo, Redbus...)
Facade	Combine multiple adapter calls under one search/booking call
Singleton	Used by services (like NotificationManager, ConfigManager)
Observer	Trigger notifications post booking (email, SMS)
5. Asynchronous Communication (Kafka)
When a booking is successful:

An event is published to Kafka.

Notification Service subscribes and sends email/SMS.

Helps in decoupling.

6. Caching
Redis (or Memcached) used to cache:

Frequent search queries (read-heavy)

Provider metadata (static info)

Use LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction strategy

7. Database
Primary: Relational DB (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

Strong consistency needed for bookings and payments

Use Read Replicas for scaling search (eventually consistent)

Secondary (Optional): NoSQL (like MongoDB) for logs or user preferences

8. Scaling Strategy
Horizontally scalable stateless microservices

Containerization with Docker, orchestrated using Kubernetes

Auto-scaling policies based on CPU/Memory usage

9. Security
HTTPS for all endpoints

JWT authentication with expiration & refresh tokens

API Gateway rate limiting to prevent abuse

10. Deployment
CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)

Canary / Blue-Green Deployment

Cloud-native deployment (AWS / GCP)

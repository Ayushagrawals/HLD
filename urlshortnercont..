Great final doubt ‚Äî and it's **super important** when designing a cache for systems like TinyURL where **billions of mappings** can exist.

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly üëá

## üß† Question:
> **If huge traffic (millions/billions of requests) is coming, how do we know how much memory/cache size is needed? Is the Redis hash map fixed-size?**

---

## ‚úÖ Key Clarifications

### 1. **Redis (or any cache) is not a fixed-size hash map**
- Redis uses internal **hash tables**, but *you* configure the **memory limit**.
- You don‚Äôt define the number of keys in advance ‚Äî Redis **grows as you insert more keys**, until it hits the **configured max memory**.

### Example:
```bash
maxmemory 4gb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```
> This means: Redis can store as much as it wants, up to 4GB. Beyond that, it starts **evicting keys** using **Least Recently Used (LRU)**.

---

## üî¢ 2. **How Do You Estimate Cache Size Needed?**

It depends on:

| Metric             | Description                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Avg Key Size       | Length of short code (e.g., 6 chars)    |
| Avg Value Size     | Length of long URL                      |
| Entry Overhead     | Metadata per key-value (roughly 50‚Äì100B)|
| Number of Entries  | How many entries you want to keep       |

### üëâ Example Estimate:
- Avg key size = 6 chars = ~6 bytes
- Avg long URL = 100 chars = ~100 bytes
- Overhead = ~100 bytes per entry
- Total per entry ‚âà 200 bytes

If you want to cache:
- **10 million mappings** ‚Üí 200 * 10M = ~2 GB
- **1 billion mappings** ‚Üí 200 * 1B = ~200 GB ‚Üí Needs a large Redis cluster or DB fallback

---

## üßä 3. **Can We Store All in Cache?**

> ‚ùå **No** ‚Äî usually not feasible or cost-effective for billions of entries.

### So what do we do?
- ‚úÖ Cache only **hot** or **recently accessed** URLs (LRU or LFU eviction).
- ‚úÖ Use **Redis + persistent DB combo**:
  - Redis handles reads for popular URLs.
  - DB is fallback when Redis doesn‚Äôt have it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Cache Strategy (Practical Setup)

| Tier         | What It Stores                         | Why It‚Äôs Needed                            |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Redis Cache  | Hot shortCode ‚Üí longUrl mappings        | Fast lookups for frequently used URLs      |
| DB (MySQL)   | All shortCode ‚Üî longUrl mappings        | Reliable storage of all mappings           |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Bonus Tip: Cache Miss Handling

If a shortCode is not in Redis:
1. Query the DB
2. If found, populate Redis again ‚Üí **Lazy loading**

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

- Redis hash map is **not fixed** in size ‚Äî it grows with data, up to the memory limit.
- You **configure** Redis memory and eviction policy.
- For huge scale, only cache **hot data**, and keep full data in DB.
- Use memory estimation (200B per entry) to guide sizing.
